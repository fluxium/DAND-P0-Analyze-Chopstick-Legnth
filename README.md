You will install Python using an Anaconda distribution, which comes with IPython notebook, as well many popular Python packages for data analysis, science, math, and engineering. Some of these packages can be difficult to install otherwise, so we highly recommend installing Anaconda. Next, you will get acquainted with an IPython notebook, responding to questions and running code.

It is not required to submit this project or to meet specifications on it, although you are welcome to resubmit until you meet specifications if you like. The project also has no deadline, but we recommend trying to complete it in the first 7 days in the program. This will let you take full advantage of an early opportunity to experience the submission process and receive feedback immediately after you put your newest skills into practice. We also highly encourage you to reach out to your study team for help and to share your work!

Prepare for this project with: Lesson 1 of Statistics. (This is the first lesson of the full Statistics course, which you will see later in the Nanodegree program.)

## Why this Project?

Data analysis involves reasoning about data, documenting your thought process and communicating results and actions. Your best analysis is only as good as your ability to communicate it. This project provides you an opportunity to work with a popular tool and gain confidence in interpreting data. You will also get a chance to apply what you've learned in Lesson 1 of Statistics using Python. You'll be going deeper in this direction during Introduction to Data Science and Project 2.

Additionally, this project will familiarize you with project submission, project review, and project feedback.

## What will I learn?

You will learn how to open an IPython notebook, run commands in an IPython notebook, and export your work as an HTML document to share. You'll also analyze the design of an experiment and interpret the results.

## Why is this important to my career?

As a Data Analyst, you will analyze data using programming languages (like Python, R and SQL) and other related packages.
Your day to day work as an analyst involves using a documentation tool to efficiently create, edit, and share data analyses.
